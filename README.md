I am a dedicated software engineer with a First-Class Honors degree in Software Engineering and currently pursuing a Master of Applied Technologies in
Computing. With experience ranging from intern to senior roles, I have developed expertise in MS Power Platform, Java, Next.js, and more. At OneFrame Ltd, I
